# Assignment 3 Notes

This framework is only to get you started; where you go from here is entirely up to you. 


## Styles

For this Assignment, you must use only one styles.css stylesheet. Within it, you will need multiple media queries.

In the largest view, your layout should become fixed-width and centred. However, background colours and background images should still span the full width of the viewport.


## Reset Code

You have been provided with 'A Modern Reset'. However, you may choose to use another CSS reset.


## Images

On Moodle, you will find your wireframe, provided to you in PSD format. All of the SVGs, with the exception of the hamburger menu, has been provided for you within this repository.  

Remember that you will need to optimise all of your images using a graphics editing program like Squoosh or Photoshop. 


## Hints

1. Make sure that you validate your code! You **must** have complete and valid HTML before you begin styling your website.

2. After writing and validating all of your markup, start with your mobile styles. 

3. The background image on the 'HAVE A PROJECT YOU WANT TO GET STARTED' banner, on the contact page, should be fixed. This will create a parallax scrolling effect. 

4. Your top-level navigation must be sticky.

5. Do not pain yourself with styling the appearance of checkboxes, radio buttons, and select elements. How they look will differ from browser to browser. However, if you are interested in learning how to style them, check out this article here:
